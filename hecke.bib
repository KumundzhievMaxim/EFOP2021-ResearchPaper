@article{Breiman2001,
abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, * * *, 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

@article{Quinlan1986,
abstract = {The technology for building knowledge-based systems by inductive inference from examples has been demonstrated successfully in several practical applications. This paper summarizes an approach to synthesizing decision trees that has been used in a variety of systems, and it describes one such system, ID3, in detail. Results from recent studies show ways in which the methodology can be modified to deal with information that is noisy and/or incomplete. A reported shortcoming of the basic algorithm is discussed and two means of overcoming it are compared. The paper concludes with illustrations of current research directions. {\textcopyright} 2004, Kluwer Academic Publishers. All rights reserved.},

@article{Stocco2015,
abstract = {We present, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that a non-invasive brain-to-brain interface (BBI) can be used to allow one human to guess what is on the mind of another human through an interactive question-and-answering paradigm similar to the "20 Questions" game. As in previous non-invasive BBI studies in humans, our interface uses electroencephalography (EEG) to detect specific patterns of brain activity from one participant (the "respondent"), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to deliver functionally-relevant information to the brain of a second participant (the "inquirer"). Our results extend previous BBI research by (1) using stimulation of the visual cortex to convey visual stimuli that are privately experienced and consciously perceived by the inquirer; (2) exploiting real-time rather than off-line communication of information from one brain to another; and (3) employing an interactive task, in which the inquirer and respondent must exchange information bi-directionally to collaboratively solve the task. The results demonstrate that using the BBI, ten participants (five inquirer-respondent pairs) can successfully identify a "mystery item" using a true/false question-answering protocol similar to the "20 Questions" game, with high levels of accuracy that are significantly greater than a control condition in which participants were connected through a sham BBI.},

@article{Lotfi2010,
abstract = {Finding the appropriate weight for each criterion is one of the main points in Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) problems. Shannon's entropy method is one of the various methods for finding weights discussed in the literature. However, in many real life problems, the data for the decision making processes cannot be measured precisely and there may be some other types of data, for instance, interval data and fuzzy data. The goal of this paper is the extension of the Shannon entropy method for the imprecise data, especially interval and fuzzy data cases. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.},

@incollection{Lewis-Beck2012,
abstract = {CHAID is a type of decision tree technique, based upon adjusted significance testing (Bonferroni testing). The technique was developed in South Africa and was published in 1980 by Gordon V. Kass, who had completed a PhD thesis on this topic. CHAID can be used for prediction (in a similar fashion to regression analysis, this version of CHAID being originally known as XAID) as well as classification, and for detection of interaction between variables. CHAID stands for CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection, based upon a formal extension of the US AID (Automatic Interaction Detection) and THAID (THeta Automatic Interaction Detection) procedures of the 1960s and 70s, which in turn were extensions of earlier research, including that performed in the UK in the 1950s.},
